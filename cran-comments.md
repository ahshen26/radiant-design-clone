## Resubmission

This is a resubmission. In this version I have fixed several bugs and added several new features (see NEWS.md for details). This version is dependent on the new version of radiant.data that was accepted yesterday.

## Test environments

* local OS X install, R 3.6.3
* local Windows install, R 3.6.2
* Ubuntu "trusty" (on travis-ci), R oldrel, release, and devel
* win-builder

## R CMD check results

There were no ERRORs, WARNINGs, or NOTEs.

## Resubmission

radiant.design was recently archived and removed from CRAN. Uwe Ligges confirmed that multiple emails were sent to my radiant@rady.ucsd.edu email address but, unfortunately, I cannot find any such emails in my inbox. I hope you will accept radiant.design as a resubmission.

radiant.design depends on the simultaneously submitted radiant.data package. From the last time I submitted updates to CRAN I seem to recall Uwe Ligges suggested I submit all radiant packages to be updated at the same time. I hope my recollection is correct and that this is indeed the preferred approach that will minimize workload for CRAN.
